                          "Strive for continous improvement, instead of perfection". This was according to Kim Collins, the world- renowned North American sprinter who worked day in and out just to be one of the best in his field. He believed that what matters most is one’s ardent desire to improve each day to get better and acquire new set of skills than to aim perfection.

                          Today, the Pangasinan State University will embark on this unique journey of online accreditation as we aim to see how much this university has developed in terms of its service to the academic community. Because of that, we make sure that quality in the academic services we offer must be of standard and at par with the best universities in the Philippines and in the ASEAN region.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          My warmest greetings to our highly-esteemed AACCUP accreditors, our solid partners in providing quality education to our nation’s future leaders. AACCUP has greatly contributed in improving the academic programs we offer along different areas, ensuring that these programs produce competent and highly employable graduates in the future. Amidst the pandemic, PSU is decisively submitting ten of its programs for accreditation with the hope that we shall successfully achieve our goals.

                          Quality assurance is an integral and crucial part to the attainment of this institution’s strategic development, vision and mission. With several quality assurance tools that our university employ, we had seen so much growth in our operations, support services and governance which led us to fully embrace continuous quality improvement, not to be perfect but to be a better performing university.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Personally, I am not solely after the award or the recognition given by accrediting bodies, rather, I am more focused on the findings and recommendations because from there, we move forward to take the path to continuous improvement. This is the reason why we have pushed hard for the online accreditation to take place despite the challenges posed by the current pandemic and by the new format that this kind of accreditation has required us to comply. We see the beauty of this undertaking which I hope you will find such appreciation and acuity reflected in the documents that we have prepared for your perusal.

                          I thank you all for joining us in creating a more responsive and relevant PSU. You have chosen to share your time and expertise with us despite the turmoil that continues to inflict the society today. Indeed, your undaunted commitment to help educational institutions continually improve in delivering quality services is greatly appreciated.

                          My heartfelt gratitude to the faculty and staff members who have tirelessly prepared all the voluminous e-documents for this activity. May we find the next days truly rewarding and beneficial for us and our beloved students.

                          Thank you very much and may God bless us all.
